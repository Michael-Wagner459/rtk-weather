## Weather Project

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.

This application uses the Open Weather API to display Temperature, Pressure, and Humidity of a city that you enter into the search bar. Once you enter a valid city into the search bar it will pop up in the display table. The table will display the city Name, Temperature, Pressure, and Humidty for 5 days. The line in the middle of the graphs is the average temp for those 5 days which is also displayed by the number below.
